# IncreaseWorkflowGUI
Python GUI built to cut start time in your work flow.

When you run the program, you can navigate your file explorer and select applications you would like to open to start your day. 

Save the program in a text file when you close the GUI, so that it keeps the applications you selected. 
If you want to clear the selected application, delete the "save.txt" file.
